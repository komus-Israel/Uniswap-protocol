[*] There are 2 types of traders

1.  Liquidity Providers: they provide the pool with the two token pairs that can be exchanged (token0 and token1). They get a 3rd token
    in return called Liquidity Token.

2.  Traders: They supply a token to the pool and gets another in exchange (send token0 and receive token1)

Uniswap helps to create trades between ERC20 token pairs

[*] Core Contracts vs Periphery contracts 

Uniswap v2 is divided into two components, a core and a periphery. This division allows the core contracts, which hold 
the assets and therefore have to be secure, to be simpler and easier to audit. All the extra functionality required by 
traders can then be provided by periphery contracts.


[*] Data Flow and Control Flow 


This is the flow of data and control that happens when you perform the three main actions of Uniswap:

1.  Swap between different tokens
2.  Add liquidity to the market and get rewarded with pair exchange ERC-20 liquidity tokens
3.  Burn ERC-20 liquidity tokens and get back the ERC-20 tokens that the pair exchange allows traders to exchange
