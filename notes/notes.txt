There are 2 types of traders

1.  Liquidity Providers: they provide the pool with the two token pairs that can be exchanged (token0 and token1). They get a 3rd token
    in return called Liquidity Token.

2.  Traders: They supply a token to the pool and gets another in exchange (send token0 and receive token1)
